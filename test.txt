The Danaus plexippus, otherwise known as the Monarch Butterfly, is best regarded for their distinctive colorings and their cross-continental annual migration. Every year, the Monarch Butterfly migrate from the United States and Canada to California and Mexico for the winter months, sometimes migrating over 3000 miles (Monarch Butterfly, u.d.). While the butterfly is most commonly found in Northern and Central America, the insect is home to other warm places where milkweed grows. Milkweed is central to Monarch Butterfly reproduction, with the female butterfly laying between 300 and 500 eggs on the underside of its leaves over a five-week period (Monarch Butterfly, u.d.). The caterpillars, who hatch just days later, feed exclusively on the plant until they undergo metamorphosis two weeks later (Monarch Butterfly, u.d.). Milkweed plays an important role in the Monarch’s life beyond just a convenient food source, the toxins within the plant are stored within the monarch butterfly making them toxic to predators, with the coloration of their wings giving warning about their toxic nature (Monarch Butterfly, u.d.). Monarch Butterflies play an important role in the ecosystem. Feeding exclusively on nectar as an adult, they pollinate wildflowers across their migratory path, while also being a food source themselves to larger predators, like birds, who are immune to the butterfly’s toxins (National parks Service, 2017).
